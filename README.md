- Play the specified notes on repeat
- Add notes whenever, even during live playing

### Features include: 
- Apply a preset of demo notes (Note: it will overwrite already defined notes!)
- Change between up to 4 tabs of musical bars 
- Switch between non-empty tabs automatically during playing
- Adjust master volume, or individual instrument volumes
- Adjust tempo, number of bars, and number of beats in each bar
- Change the instrument of choice for each row

### Possible future additions: 
- Add custom theming
- Save user-defined notes before applying demo, and allow returning to the previous state after trying out demo
- Export the user-defined notes in a json file and download it to a local storage
- Import notes from a local json file
